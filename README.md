PolyTop is a touchscreen application that is aimed at helping the composer define his own topology of timbre and discover means of traversing it. Timbre is a multidimensional feature of sound and exploring it involves mapping parameters to reduce their number to a number controllable with a finger gesture. Given the limitations of such gesture, it is of interest to define a method and create a tool that simplifies traversal as well as analysis of timbre space. In PolyTop timbre space is defined by a set of Node timbres - reference points that are used to calculate in-between timbres. The name of the app, PolyTop - short for polyphonic topology - indicates that multitouch is involved and the role of independent voices is addressed.

PolyTop consists of Android GUI (client) and SuperCollider DSP (server) that connect via network.
